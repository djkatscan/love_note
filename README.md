# Love Notes

*Not Published on Amazon*  Alexa skill to ask for a love note

## About

I wanted to create a skill for my boyfriend that let him  "ask for a love note" :love_letter: and get a randomized set of phrases of my choice.  It soon evolved (with his input) into a skill with several options.

## Alexa, ask for a love:
* Note: love notes are about "loving you"
* Quote: love quotes are famous quotes about love
* Message: are directed to the person asking, e.g "I love you to the moon and back!"
* Secret:  You can customize these to your liking

Edit to add:  this code was written 10 months ago and hasnt been tested recently :)
